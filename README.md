##JavaScript Problems

Just another repo to keep my knives sharp. In a framework riddled front-end world, we don't get a chance to solve interesting problems everyday. These are some of the challenges that I've come across in the wild. 

PS: Solutions are intentionally verbose to make it easier to read and understand (and not necessarily the shortest possible solution)
